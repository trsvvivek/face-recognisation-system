# Face Recognition System

## Overview
The **Face Recognition System** is an application that detects and recognizes faces from images or live video feeds. It utilizes machine learning models to match faces with stored data and can be used for security, authentication, and attendance systems.

## Features
- Face detection from images and video streams
- Face recognition and user identification
- Real-time processing with OpenCV
- Database storage for known faces
- Secure and efficient authentication system

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition.git
cd face-recognition
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib face-recognition numpy
```

### Run the Application
```bash
python face_recognition.py
```

## Usage
1. Add known faces to the database.
2. Run the application to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
3. The system will match detected faces with stored data and display results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for backend logic
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Dlib & Face-Recognition Library** for face detection
- **SQLite/MySQL** for database storage (if applicable)
